# DAY 2

- SDF and ray marching

- CodeParade https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svLzmFuSBhk -> very promising
- Is it possible to convert MB3D fractals to SDF fractals? -> MB3D is already an SDF engine, I think

## MB3D Formulas

They are x86 assembly, use https://defuse.ca/online-x86-assembler.htm to disassemble

## SDF ray marching engine

- GLSL fragment or compute shader in environment
- environment is preferably Vulkan in Rust, but Rust might not be the fastest for ideation here...
- should also include VR 360 output on Quest 2 (for Rust, that would require a lot of setup)
- "Makepad or Flutter"? - not important at first, focus on GLSL part first in whatever environment

This forks off into germansmedia/sdf
