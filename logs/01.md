# MANDELBULB EXPLORATION

Initially go two directions:

1. See if we can improve Julius' flow with making new things. Thereby get to know the Mandelbulb world and what kind of problems exist.

    - what does this flow look like currently?
    - what are the big problems?
    - what does Julius see as awesome new possibilities in this flow?

2. Create a new fractal rendering and animation tool, possibly including realtime components, interactivity, compositing, VR, etc.

## SOME TOPICS

- reduce source size
- increase resolution
- interactivity
- f64 support
- 2xf32 to improve precision

## double-double precision

## Mandelbulber

- Linux
- full OpenCL support, very fast on 2080
- can do prettymuch everything I can image, so we really need Julius to make this fly on the software side too, i.e. how can Mandelbulber be improved?
