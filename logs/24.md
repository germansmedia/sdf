# DAY 24

Interlaced rendering works a little bit, but:

- something weird is going on with uniform buffers and descriptor sets
- it should be called Progressive Rendering instead

Exploring push constants in E and migrating there if that works. That works.

## Meeting Julius

- BRDF material
- BRDF parameters dependent on iteration number
- AmazingSurf
- 8k, high res
- interaction with existing objects
- color mapping to height field
- pointcloud/object as fractal base
- space navigator

## Continue...

- rename Interlaced to Progressive
- different order for progressive rendering
