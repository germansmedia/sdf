# DAY 19

After playing around with this setup, I found that the biggest problem is undersampling. The ray marching algorithm effectively misses some matter sometimes. This is clearly visible when flying around the Mandelbox. Analytical objects, like just a sphere, don't exhibit this problem, so I'm going to undress the Mandelbox and study the math, to see if I can figure out why it is missing some matter.

When adding a glow (indication of the closest distance), it does seem like there is enough information to suggest an object in the area (i.e. the glow itself does not show undersampling artefacts).

- implement pixel footprint analysis to reduce aliasing problems with distant objects

```glsl
float raycast(
    vec3 ro,  // ray origin
    vec3 rd,  // ray direction
    float tmin,  // minimum distance
    float tmax  // maximum distance
)
{
    // start at minimum distance
    float t = tmin;
    for( int i=0; i<kMaxIterations && t<tmax; i++ )  // 'iterations' here means ray marching steps
    {

        // get SDF
        float d = map( ro + t*rd );

        // if close enough to object (including pixel footprint), return distance to object
        if( d<t*kPixel ) return t;

        // add distance traveled
        t += d;
    }

    // no object found
    return -1.0;
}
```

This seems like a better start for exploration than MandelBulb's ray marcher.

- implement a mode where you can see the number of ray marching steps made for each pixel as a heat map

- use gamma correction at the end, or render to sRGB

- diffuse colors at 0.2

- surface lit by key light of around 1.5 should result around 0.5

- don't use AO for the key light

- second light is from the sky at 0.2, usually blue

- third light is for global illumination simulation, 0.3, slight yellow saturation

```glsl
// compute materials
vec3 material = doFantasticMaterialColor( pos, nor );

// lighting terms
float occ = doGorgeousOcclusion( pos, nor );
float sha = doGreatSoftShadow( pos, sunDir );
float sun = clamp( dot( nor, sunDir ), 0.0, 1.0 );
float sky = clamp( 0.5 + 0.5*nor.y, 0.0 1.0 );
float ind = clamp( dot( nor, normalize(sunDir*vec3(-1.0,0.0,-1.0)) ), 0.0, 1.0 );

// compute lighting
vec3 lin  = sun*vec3(1.64,1.27,0.99)*pow(vec3(sha),vec3(1.0,1.2,1.5));
        lin += sky*vec3(0.16,0.20,0.28)*occ;
        lin += ind*vec3(0.40,0.28,0.20)*occ;

// multiply lighting and materials
vec3 color = material * lin;

// apply fog
color = doWonderfullFog( color, pos );

// gamma correction
color = pow( color, vec3(1.0/2.2) );

// display
displayColor = color;
```

- look at smooth-min as well: https://iquilezles.org/articles/smin/

## So...

* remove current parameters from the code
* clean up remaining code
* convert engine to have multiple modes:

    1. output color
    2. output depth, encoded as grayscale
    3. surface normal, encoded as RGB
    4. number of iterations into the fractal, encoded as rainbow
    5. number of steps during marching, encoded as rainbow
    6. output depth, encoded as rainbow
    7. ambient occlusion, encoded as grayscale

- implement binary search
+ implement analytical normals
- implement non-analytical normals

### E

+ try not to encode everything in floats, but compact structs instead, see if glsl can have the same footprint as rust
- floating-bar rationals? :)
