# DAY 14

Time to pick up trying to remake Julius shot again. Implemented all formulas, doesn't yet work entirely, but there is a result, and it does look like it has similar components.

I should also build the glow effect now.

It works somewhat, the results are not yet the same as mb3d, but the components seem to interact.
