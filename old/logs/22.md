# DAY 22

Going to merge the system code back to E, so that will be the underlying project, and development towards other platforms, etc. is going in there.

Then, gotta attempt that koch cube again.

Koch cube works!! And so does AmazingBox2 and a bunch of others. The iconic shot from Recombination almost works, and I might want to continue to find it later, but for now this is enough.

## The Greater Plan

Chat with Julius about the following topics:

1. redevelop MB3D, but different format

2. MB3D compatibility

3. different output setups (multiple screens, domes, VR, etc.)

4. postprocessing effects

5. editing MB3D code directly

6. realtime stuff

7. VR and AR
