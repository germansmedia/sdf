# DAY 26

Today should be some code cleanup and implementing other formulas. For instance, BulboxP-2.

Also started thinking about how to combine distance fields with these fractals... Maybe play around with some stuff...

## Also

- Look at USD and maybe the possibility to integrate in that pipeline; this would be useful for more people than just Julius
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m43l9RXJcYg
- Contact other fractal formula writers and see if they can help with the shaders
- Contact Ean to check his thoughts on using Blender
- Contact Stephane for his thoughts on USD

## The App

- the app should become a new navigator that allows fractal artists to dream up stuff
- it should be able to copy/paste the mandelbulb3d state data
- projects should be USD
- pivot towards using Makepad for the underlying tech
- figure out what other tools exist around USD to help realize new crazy video projects
