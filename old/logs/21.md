# DAY 21

Added depth-of-field effect, seems to work nicely. Playing around with Menger3 parameters is interesting.

I think the ultimate project is more like a separate synthesizer next to MB3D, instead of trying to exactly copy MB3D. Compatibility is one thing, but giving the ability to explore another bunch of fractals in a different way can add to the creation experience. Besides, getting tools online to work in the existing workflow is maybe a better alternative than spending a lot of time and effort in trying to deconstruct MB3D.

So this does mean that the primary output of the synthesizer will just be PNGs, or whatever format is in fashion right now.

Now, it's still useful to try to recreate some of Julius' stuff, before designing a bigger tool. One reason is to learn about going beyond these basic fractals, and really understanding how MB3D features are used and why.
