# DAY 18

After fixing a lot of bugs in my math code, I managed to add a bit of interactivity to the program. Now it's easier to figure out what is wrong, and easier to make interesting screenshots. I should make all parameters updatable with keys, so it becomes clear how this works.

Also it seems koch_cube is wrong, so I will need to rebuild it from the assembly code.
