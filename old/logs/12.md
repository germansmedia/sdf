# DAY 12

Got a scene from Julius to render. Let's see if I can already reverse engineer the MB3D parameters. First render it on real MB3D, to get an idea of what we're looking at. Also take the initial parameters of MB3D as a scene to recreate.

Some dev questions:

- which formulas does the example contain? Does it use hybrid slots? - all 6 of em...

Slot 1: _reciprocalZ3b

    Limiter1 = 1.37 (0.67)
    Limiter2 = 0.67
    mul1     = 1.775 (1)
    mul2     = 1

Slot 2: _Rotate4d

    Rotation YZ = 0
    Rotation XZ = 180 (0)
    Rotation XY = 180 (0)
    Rotation XW = 0
    Rotation YW = 0
    Rotation ZW = 0

Slot 3: _PolyFold-sym

    Order   = 64 (4)
    Shift   = 0
    Shift X = 0
    Shift Y = 0
    Skew    = 0

Slot 4: AmazingBox2

    Scale          = 1.05 (2)
    Min R          = 0.2 (0.5)
    Fold           = 1.525 (1)
    Rotate X       = 0
    Rotate Y       = 0
    Rotate Z       = 0
    Inv XC         = 0.6342625 (0.5)
    Inv YC         = 0
    Inv ZC         = 0
    Inv Radius     = 1
    FoldX XY angle = 0
    FoldX XZ angle = 0

Slot 5: koch_cube

    Post-scale = 0.148106 (1)
    XY Stretch = 0.089698 (1)
    Z Fold     = 0.049021 (1)
    X Add      = 0.039634 (0)
    Y Add      = -0.081354 (0)
    Z Add      = -0.003129 (0)
    Rotation X = -0.1016925 (0)
    Rotation Y = 0.0547575 (0)
    Rotation Z = 4.35745061105293E-308 (0)

Slot 6: _reciprocalZ3b

    Limiter 1 = 1.27 (0.67)
    Limiter 2 = 0.92 (0.67)
    mul1      = 2.05 (1)
    mul2      = 1

## Thoughts

- Let's try a few simpler examples first
- koch_cube seems to work, but precision might be off
- both AmazingBox2 and koch_cube have analytical distance estimations, so that should help a lot
