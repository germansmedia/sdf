# TODO

- discrete color palettes
- discrete BRDF values
- color textures
- BRDF textures
- systemize TC and albedo generation from iteration, step count, closest distance, residual vector, residual vector difference, etc.
- neon glow flow over these discrete palettes
- self-illumination
- subsurface scattering
- rework output format system (stereo, jpg+png, quad, fisheye, etc.)
