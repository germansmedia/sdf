# TODO

- scale pose matrix hyperbolically
- if that doesn't work, separate pose into actual pose and do the matrix transformation at the end
- discrete color palettes
- discrete BRDF values
- color textures
- BRDF textures
- systemize TC and albedo generation from iteration, step count, closest distance, residual vector, residual vector difference, etc.
- neon glow flow over these discrete palettes
- self-illumination
- subsurface scattering
- rework output format system (stereo, jpg+png, quad, fisheye, etc.)
