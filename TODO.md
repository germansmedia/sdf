# TODO

- combine March and Render into one struct that represents the current parameter space
- make a function that outputs one of those parameter structs, based on two input structs and an interpolation value, linear only at first
- place the keyframes in VR with the photo button
- after the second keyframe, render 5 seconds worth of frames
- discrete color palettes
- discrete BRDF values
- color textures
- BRDF textures
- systemize TC and albedo generation from iteration, step count, closest distance, residual vector, residual vector difference, etc.
- neon glow flow over these discrete palettes
- self-illumination
- subsurface scattering
- rework output format system (stereo, jpg+png, quad, fisheye, etc.)
